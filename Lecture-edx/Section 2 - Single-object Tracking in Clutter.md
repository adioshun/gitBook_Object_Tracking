#### 2.1.1 Introduction to SOT in clutter

- SOT in clutter is a special case of MOT 

- 하나의 물체만 존재 

- This makes single object tracking more similar to Kalman filtering and the type of nonlinear
filtering problems 

- challenges 
    - Time varying state variables
    - Noisy measurement 
    - missed detection 
    - clutter detection (잡음)
    - Unknown data associations
