 if assignment was always unambiguous, we could turn MTT(Multi Target Tracking) into independent single-target tracking problems. However, when the association is ambiguous (multiple observations in one gating region; common observations in multiple gating regions ), then the assignment decisions become coupled and much harder to solve.
