# Low resolution lidar-based multi-object tracking for driving applications

http://www.iri.upc.edu/files/scidoc/1924-Low-resolution-lidar-based-multi-object-tracking-for-driving-applications.pdf


# Abstract

we developed a lidar-based system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to perform pointwise vehicle detection using PUCK data, and Multi-Hypothesis Extended Kalman Filters (MH-EKF), to estimate the actual position and velocities of the detected vehicles.

- 초기 접근은 CNN을 바로 적용 하였다. `Some early approaches on using CNNs to detect vehicles over 3D lidar point clouds make use of 3D convolutions [14] or sparse 3D convolutions acting as voting weights for predicting the detection scores [8, 10]. `

- 하지만, Lidar 포인트클라우드의 특징(고차원, 희박성)으로 인하여 연산 부하가 크다. `However, due to the high dimensionality and sparsity
of 3D lidar data, deploying them over point clouds implies high computational burden.`

- 또다른 접근법은 3D 포인트 클라우드를 2D representation으로 바꾸어 2D CNN을 적용 한다. `Another adopted approach is to apply the well know 2D convolution tools over equivalent 2D representations of the 3D point cloud. `

- In this way, [15] predicts the objectness of each point as well as vehicle 3D bounding boxes by applying a Fully Convolutional Network over a front view representation in which each element encodes a ground-measured distance and height of the corresponding
3D point.

The recent evolution of [15] combines RGB images with lidar information to generate accurate 3D bounding box proposals, obtaining state of the art results in the detection challenge of the Kitti dataset [5].
  - However, this method does not fulfill the lidar-only requirement that we impose in our work.

# 3. System Description


- 구성
  1. an initial preprocessing step of the lidar information
  2. a convolutional network performs per-point vehicle detection, which results are later used to obtain bounding boxes of vehicle proposals.
  3. using as additional input the ego-odometry, these vehicle proposals are tracked through time, obtaining information about their poses, dimensions and velocities.

## 3.1 Data Arrangement

Kitti 데이터셋에서 GT는 앞면 이미지에만 있으므로, 3D 데이터를 이와 같은 앵글로 변경

As the Kitti tracking benchmark provides only labels for the elements within the front camera field of view, we restrict our 3D point cloud to the corresponding angles.

The remaining points are then transformed for the elements within the front camera field of view, we restrict our 3D point cloud to the corresponding angles.

## 3.4 Lidar-based Vehicle Tracking

이전 연구에서 했던 방식처럼 2D로 변경후 MH-EKF 사용하여 추적 수행

The tracking system has been implemented following the same 2D approach that in our previous work [26], which results in a reasonable simplification since wheeled vehicles transit on the road plane.
