# Confidence-Based Pedestrian Tracking

we address the problem of tracking multiple pedestrians in unstructured 3D point clouds by extracting and discarding additional candidates from vegetation and other structures. 


Our approach 
- works exclusively on LIDAR-based features and 
- uses split and merge steps that create additional candidates which are classified with a SVM

Tracking is performed by using a particle filter 
- where particles require a recurring re-detection with a high confidence value from the classifier. 
- Thus, we enforce a rapid disposal of particles without adequate re-activation.

## I. INTRODUCTION

차량 탐지 대비 보행자 탐지가 어려운 이유 `Pedestrians are challenging obstacles due to`
- the either stationary or moving state, 
- the highly varying appearance,
- and the complex movement characteristics. 
    - a pedestrian can move over difficult terrain surfaces and 
    - walk in arbitrary directions whereas cars are limited to the driving direction. 
- in groups, pedestrians might be walking very closely and occlude each other.

## III. PEDESTRIAN DETECTION

### 3.1 Ground Removal

정의 : The Task of ground removal is to separate obstacle points from ground points (cf. [11], [15]) in order to reduce the computational load and to perform a first selection of candidates. 

높이 정보를 기준으로 하면 실패 가능성이 높다. `In unstructured environments, an assumption of a planar ground surface with a fixed ground height is likely to fail. `
- Planar ground regions are often interrupted by hills, ditches, and other surface variations. 

In our approach, 
1. we first insert the 3D data into a three-dimensional grid with a resolution of $$0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1m^3$$ per cell. 
2. Afterwards, the cells are sorted according to their height(computed from the highest and the lowest point in each cell) from high to low. 
3. Each of those candidate cell is not only classified wrt. the contained points, but also wrt. the neighboring cells. 
4. A sliding window with a height threshold is used to calculate the absolute difference between the highest and the lowest point among all point of the current cell and in addition all points of neighboring cell. 
5. Based on the resulting values, a cell is classified as Empty, Ground or Obstacle

### 3.2 Clustering

The ground removal algorithm yields groups of cells which contain obstacles. 

Afterwards, those groups need to be prepared for **feature extraction** and **classification**. 

- On the one hand, the clustering algorithm needs to cluster obstacle cells to groups of sufficiently large 3D distance measurements which represent pedestrian candidates. 

- On the other hand, the algorithm needs to split up large groups of 3D points in order to separate pedestrians from other obstacles which are close to them, including trees, building and other pedestrians.

Our approach consists of two steps and aims to find a high number of pedestrian candidates even if they are located close to other objects. 

We explicitly choose not to discard anything in the slightest similarity to a human. 

Thus, our next step is to further analyze clusters that are too large to represent a single candidate, which in turn yields increased runtime. 

In order to keep the overall runtime low, several algorithms were inspected. 

- k-mean 방법은 k값과, 초기설정이 필요한 단점이 있다. `Approaches like k-means [13] exhibit fast runtimes but the original algorithm requires`
    - knowledge of the number of clusters k in advance and 
    - an imprecise initial configuration of the medians may drastically increase the runtime. 

- 해결책 #1 : The k-means++ extension [1] improves the initial distribution and provides faster runtimes. 

- 해결책 # 2 : The problem of an unknown k is solved by the dp-means algorithm [12], which we use and that starts with k = 1 and increments it, if a cluster grows too large, and in addition exhibits fast runtimes. 

A resulting separated cluster is exemplary shown in Fig. 1 where the replaced cluster is framed in blue and the
new clusters are framed in green.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mmsurMa.png)

The aforementioned step results in an over-clustering of large obstacles, which are now separated wrt. the extent of pedestrians. 

Hence, our next step is to re-merge nearby clusters without a gap between them. 

The distance between the centers of two clusters is divided into eight histogram bins and if the two bins in the middle contain less than 80% of the measurements compared to the average number of measurements in all bins, a gap is detected. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/H0kaInu.png)

An example of re-merged clusters is shown in Fig. 2. Here, the new smaller clusters cannot be separated adequately and the original group is maintained. 

This strategy has the advantage of finding pedestrian candidates close to any other obstacles at the expense of an increased runtime and the possibility of more false-positives.



### 3.3 Features (7개)

Our feature vector per cluster consists of 8 different features introduced in the literature, 
- where f1 and f2 are presented by Premebida et al. [17] and describe the number of points included in a cluster and the minimum distance of the cluster to the sensor. 
- Navarro-Serment et al. [15] apply a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the clusters, which represents f3 to f7. 

Those features are the 3D covariance matrix of a cluster, the normalized moment of inertia tensor, the 2D covariance matrix in different zones (cf. [15]), the normalized 2D histogram for the main plane and the normalized 2D histogram for the secondary plane. 

In another approach, Kidono et al. [11] introduce two additional features. 
- The first one, the slice feature of a cluster, forms our last feature f8 and aims to differentiate pedestrians from false positives in the shape of trees or poles. 
    - A cluster is partitioned into slices along the z-axis and for each slice the first and second largest eigenvalue is calculated. 
    - As the descriptive power of the slice feature decreases over longer distances, only a rough estimate remains in long distances.
- The other feature introduced by Kidono et al. considers the distribution of the reflection intensities in the cluster. 
    -Since our LRF is not calibrated wrt. the intensities, this feature could not be integrated.
    
### 3.4 Classification & Training

분류 목적 : 이진 분류 (사람 or NOT) `The task of the classifier is to perform a binary classification
between pedestrian and non-pedestrian as precise as possible.`

알고리즘 :SVM + RBF 커널 `As proposed by Kidono et al. [11], we use a SVM with radial basis function (RBF) Kernel [4], [5] together`

Feature : 본 논문 3.3에서 언급한 특징들

학습 데이터 : For training the SVM we annotated pedestrians in different datasets from the campus Koblenz of the University of Koblenz-Landau, 
- which contain vegetation, trees and buildings.
- Positive samples are extracted from annotations and negative samples are generated at random from clusters that have not been marked as pedestrians by a human annotator.

학습 알고리즘 : For this work, we used the LIBSVM library from Chang and Lin [4] that computes a separating hyperplane which
discriminates between the pedestrian and non-pedestrian.

분류 이후 작업 : Our classifier returns a vector of confidence values in [0, 1] for each class how likely a candidate belongs to the class. 
- The probability of the highest rated class is used as input value for the tracking system

## IV. PEDESTRIAN TRACKING

Our initial idea for the tracking was to use virtual 2D scans and was inspired by Petrovskaya and Thrun [16]. 

With an adopted measurement model we observed that, with a high resolution 2D scan, many pedestrians could be successfully tracked. 

Unlike, in urban scenarios varying inclination angles of the terrain and many occlusions, e.g. caused by vegetation, are problematic. 

Hence, we developed a new measurement model and decided to focus on an sophisticated interaction of the detection algorithm with the particle filter. 

This allows our approach to discard hypotheses early and enables it to deal efficiently with false detection that occur frequently in unstructured environments.
